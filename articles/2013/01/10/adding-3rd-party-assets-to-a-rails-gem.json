Queue my problem.</p>\n<p>Adding my custom CSS and Javascript to the\nasset pipeline was pretty simple, but the minute I tried to <code>//= require</code> a 3rd pary asset within a file, I would get a <em>File not found</em> error.\nIt drove me nuts. No matter what I tried, it didn&#39;t work. I figured that the asset path was relative and I wasn&#39;t adding the correct path.\nThat was not the case. After checking out a few other gems that included 3rd party assets, I discovered the problem. Turns out that,\neven though I was adding the dependancy to the gemspec, it still wasn&#39;t being included in the pipeline for compilation. It needed to\nbe required in <code>lib/utility_box.rb</code>. The minute I did that, all the <code>//= require</code> and <code>#= require</code> started to work.</p>\n"}
