If you have a 0 in there\nthat indicates that your computer is not trying to keep the connection alive\n(it is disabled), otherwise it tells you how often (in seconds) it is sending\nthe aforementioned packet. Try putting 120 or 240, if it is still killing your\nconnection, you can go lower, maybe to 5, if with that number it doesn&#39;t happen,\nmaybe it is your router who is dumping the connection to free memory.</p>\n"}
